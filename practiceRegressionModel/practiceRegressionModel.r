# One of the aims of this package is to make life easier for
# useRs who deal with survey data sets. It provides an
# infrastructure for the management of survey data including
# value labels, definable missing values, recoding of variables,
# production of code books, and import of (subsets of) SPSS and
# Stata files. Further, it provides functionality to produce
# tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive statistics and
# (almost) publication-ready tables of regression model
# estimates, which can be exported to LaTeX and HTML.
