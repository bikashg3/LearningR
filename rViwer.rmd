RStudio includes a data viewer that allows you to look inside data frames and other rectangular data structures. 
The viewer also allows includes some simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
features that can help you understand the data as you manipulate it with R.

You can invoke the viewer in a console by calling the View function on the data frame you want to look at. 
For instance, to view the built-in iris dataset, run these commands:

```{r}
data(iris)
View(iris)
```

You can also start the viewer by clicking on the table data icon on the right, in the environment pane:

Sorting

Filtering

Searching

Auto-refreshing

Labels
```{r}
library(Hmisc)
data(women)
label(women[[1]]) <- "Woman's Height"
label(women[[2]]) <- "Woman's Weight"
View(women)
```
